#  Food Delivery Platform Analytics (SQL + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a food delivery platform using **SQL‑driven analytics** to identify
operational inefficiencies, customer experience issues, and revenue leakage.

The goal of the analysis is to demonstrate how data analytics can support
**business decision‑making** by connecting operations → customer experience → revenue impact.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
The food delivery platform operates across multiple cities with a large network of restaurants
and delivery partners. Despite high order volumes, the platform faces challenges such as:
- High order cancellations
- Delivery delays (SLA breaches)
- Declining customer ratings
- Potential revenue loss

This project aims to diagnose **where the problems occur, why they occur, and how much they cost the business**.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Framework
The analysis is structured into **four business-focused blocks**:

1. **Platform Supply & Presence**  
   Understanding restaurant and delivery partner distribution across cities.

2. **Pricing & Order Value (AOV)**  
   Analyzing customer spending behavior and pricing power across cities and cuisines.

3. **Operational Efficiency**  
   Measuring cancellations, delivery delays, and SLA breaches.

4. **Customer Experience & Revenue Impact**  
   Evaluating ratings and estimating revenue loss due to cancellations.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Platform demand and revenue are highly concentrated in metro cities such as **Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi**.
- The overall cancellation rate is high, indicating systemic operational inefficiencies rather than isolated issues.
- Delivery delays have a strong negative impact on customer ratings, directly affecting customer satisfaction.
- Order cancellations result in significant **estimated revenue loss**, especially in high‑volume cities.
- Targeted operational improvements in priority cities can lead to meaningful revenue recovery.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL** – Core data analysis and business logic
- **Python (Google Colab)** – Data exploration and query execution
- **Power BI** – 1‑page executive dashboard
- **Notion** – Project documentation and storytelling
- **GitHub** – Version control and portfolio hosting

---

## 🗂 Data Schema
The project uses anonymized CSV‑based data modeled using fact and dimension tables.

- Fact tables store transactional and operational data
- Dimension tables provide contextual information (city, restaurant, customer, delivery partner)

Detailed schema documentation is available in `data/sample_schema.md`.

---

## 📈 Dashboard
A 1‑page Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Key platform KPIs
- City‑level performance
- Operational bottlenecks
- Customer experience and revenue impact

The dashboard is designed for **executive‑level decision making**.

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates how **SQL‑driven analytics** can be used to:
- Diagnose operational inefficiencies
- Link customer experience to delivery performance
- Quantify revenue impact
- Support data‑backed business decisions
